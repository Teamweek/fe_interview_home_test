# Teamweek Take Home Project

## The Mission

Hello there future Teamweek Frontend Developer! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to replicate the drag and drop functionality that is available on our [Timeline](http://teamweek.com) product, from this template.

The template already has the layout figured out for you. You're therefore only required to enable horizontal dragging of the element labeled "Task 1", along the light gray row. **Please pay special attention to how the element snaps in place (the columns) while being dragged**. Here is a screenshot and video demoing the same:

## Getting started on your machine

The first step is to fork this repo so that a fork exists on your own GitHub account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version down onto your machine.

Install the repo's dependencies:

`npm install`

Then start the local server:

`npm start`

You should be able to see the app running on port `1234`!

Please remember to commit often so we can see how you're tracking...

## Objectives

- Be familiar with the [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and [Drag n Drop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) APIs.
- Have a basic understanding of Teamweek's Timeline drag & drop functionality

## Deploy

Once done, publish a minified build of the project to [Surge](http://surge.sh) or [Now](https://zeit.co), and share the public URL.
To generate the build, run:

    $ npm run build

And then upload the generated `dist` folder. For example,

    $ surge -d my-project-url.surge.sh -p dist
